You are given a list of non-negative integers `prices` representing the daily stock prices of a company in chronological order. Return a list of the same length where the value at index `i` is the minimum number of days you would have to wait until you make a profit. If there's no way to make a profit the value should be `0`.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `prices`

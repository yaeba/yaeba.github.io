title: "2048"
---

In the game 2048, you are given a 4 by 4 board of numbers (some of them empty, represented in our case with `0`) which you can swipe in any of the 4 directions (`"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"`, or `"right"`). When you swipe, all the numbers move in that direction as far as possible and identical adjacent numbers are combined to form their sum exactly once. Given a 2D matrix of integers `board` representing the initial board and a string `direction` representing the swipe direction, implement the next board state.

**Constraints**

- `n = 4` where `n` is the number of rows and columns in `board`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- board =

```
[[2,0,0,2],
 [2,2,2,2],
 [0,4,2,2],
 [2,2,2,0]]
```

- direction = `left`

**Output**

- answer = `[[4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0, 0]]`

**Explanation**

All the values are moved as leftmost as possible and identical adjacent values are merged exactly once, starting from the end.

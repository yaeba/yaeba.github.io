Given a list of integers `nums`, remove numbers that appear multiple times in the list, while maintaining order of the appearance in the original list.

It should use $$\mathcal{O}(k)$$ space where `k` is the number of unique integers.

**Constraints**

- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `nums`

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input**

- nums = `[1, 3, 5, 0, 3, 5, 8]`

Only [1, 0, 8] are unique in the list and that's the order they appear in.
